## Features

- Dark Theme! Lunar Blue currently has a well-designed dark theme!

- JSX Support. Lunar Blue highlights JSX as good as any other language. This includes JSX in TypeScript (`.tsx`) files!

- Vue support. This theme supports Vue.js as well!

## May Come Up (Hopefully)

- Light Theme. We may release a Light Theme soon!

- High Contrast. Since, quite a few people like high contrast, we are considering making one!
